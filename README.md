# ALIGN fine-tuning
This project tries to fine-tune a [ALIGN](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/align) for the purpes for word spotting. The goal is to get a generlized model that can do some word spotting on unseen languages.

The original idea were to incorperate this as the image endocer used in [czsl](https://github.com/ExplainableML/czsl) to get it to do word spotting but with better preformence and even better generlization to diffrent languages.
